	<h1>Basic Rules of Accounting</h1>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Business Entity Concept:</strong> The financial transactions of a business must be recorded separately from those of its owner(s) or any other business.</li>
		<li><strong>Going Concern Concept:</strong> The financial statements of a business are prepared on the assumption that the business will continue to operate indefinitely.</li>
		<li><strong>Money Measurement Concept:</strong> Only those transactions that can be expressed in monetary terms are recorded in the books of accounts.</li>
		<li><strong>Cost Concept:</strong> Assets are recorded at their original cost price and are not revalued in the books of accounts.</li>
		<li><strong>Duality Concept:</strong> Every transaction has two aspects - debit and credit, and the total of debits must be equal to the total of credits.</li>
		<li><strong>Accounting Period Concept:</strong> The financial statements of a business are prepared for a specific period of time, usually a year or a quarter.</li>
		<li><strong>Matching Concept:</strong> Revenues and expenses are recorded in the same accounting period in which they occur.</li>
		<li><strong>Conservatism Concept:</strong> When there is uncertainty about the value of an asset or liability, the accountant should record the lower value in the books of accounts.</li>
		<li><strong>Materiality Concept:</strong> Only significant transactions and events are recorded in the books of accounts.</li>
		<li><strong>Consistency Concept:</strong> Accounting policies and procedures should be applied consistently from one period to the next.</li>
