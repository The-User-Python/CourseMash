	<h1>Theory Part of Chemistry - Grade 11</h1>
	<h2>Chapter 1: Some Basic Concepts of Chemistry</h2>
	<p>Chemistry is the study of matter, its properties, and the changes it undergoes. This chapter introduces some of the basic concepts of chemistry such as the nature of matter, laws of chemical combinations, mole concept, empirical and molecular formulae, stoichiometry, and volumetric analysis.</p>

	<h2>Chapter 2: Structure of Atom</h2>
	<p>Atoms are the building blocks of matter. In this chapter, we study the various models proposed for the structure of atom, the discovery of subatomic particles, their properties, and arrangement in an atom. The chapter also covers the quantum mechanical model of atom, the electronic configuration of atoms and periodic classification of elements based on electronic configuration.</p>

	<h2>Chapter 3: Classification of Elements and Periodicity in Properties</h2>
	<p>The properties of elements are periodic functions of their atomic numbers. This chapter covers the periodic classification of elements based on their electronic configuration and the periodic trends in their physical and chemical properties. The chapter also introduces the concept of valency and the formation of chemical bonds.</p>

	<h2>Chapter 4: Chemical Bonding and Molecular Structure</h2>
	<p>Chemical bonds are the forces that hold atoms together in molecules and compounds. This chapter covers the various types of chemical bonds such as ionic, covalent, and metallic bonds. The chapter also covers the shapes of simple molecules and the VSEPR theory, hybridization of atomic orbitals and the molecular orbital theory of homonuclear diatomic molecules.</p>

	<h2>Chapter 5: States of Matter</h2>
	<p>Matter exists in three states - solid, liquid, and gas. This chapter covers the intermolecular forces that hold particles together in different states of matter, the characteristics of each state of matter, and the concept of the gas laws.</p>

	<h2>Chapter 6: Thermodynamics</h2>
	<p>Thermodynamics deals with the study of energy and its transformation. This chapter covers the various thermodynamic terms such as heat, work, internal energy, enthalpy, and the laws of thermodynamics. The chapter also covers the concept of entropy and the spontaneity of chemical reactions.</p>

	<h2>Chapter 7: Equilibrium</h2>
	<p>Chemical equilibrium is the state where the rate of the forward and reverse reactions is equal. This chapter covers the law of chemical equilibrium, the equilibrium constant, factors affecting equilibrium, the concept of Le Chatelier's principle, and the relationship between equilibrium constant and Gibbs energy change.</p>

	<h2>Chapter 8: Redox Reactions</h2>
	<p>Redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons from one species to another. This chapter covers the concept of oxidation and reduction, balancing redox reactions using oxidation number method and half-reaction method, electrochemical cells, and the Nernst equation.</p>

	<h2>Chapter 9: Hydrogen</h2>
	<p>Hydrogen is the first element in the periodic table. This chapter covers the position of hydrogen in the periodic table, its isotopes, preparation, properties, and uses of dihydrogen. The chapter also covers the concept of hydrogen bonding and its importance in biological systems.</p>
