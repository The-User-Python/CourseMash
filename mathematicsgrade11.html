</head>
<body>
	<h1>Mathematics UNIT-1:Sets&Function's</h1>
	<h1>Sets</h1>
	<p>A set is a collection of objects, which are called elements or members of the set. Sets are usually denoted by capital letters, and their elements are denoted by small letters. For example, if we have a set of numbers from 1 to 5, we can write it as:</p>
	<p>A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}</p>
	<p>Here, A is the set, and {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} are its elements.</p>

	<h2>Types of Sets</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Finite Set:</strong> A set is said to be finite if it has a definite number of elements.</li>
		<li><strong>Infinite Set:</strong> A set is said to be infinite if it has an infinite number of elements.</li>
		<li><strong>Empty Set:</strong> A set which has no element is called an empty set or null set, and it is denoted by the symbol &empty; or {}.</li>
		<li><strong>Singleton Set:</strong> A set which has only one element is called a singleton set.</li>
		<li><strong>Equal Sets:</strong> Two sets are said to be equal if they have exactly the same elements. For example, {1, 2, 3} = {2, 1, 3}.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Set Operations</h2>
	<p>There are several operations which can be performed on sets, including:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Union:</strong> The union of two sets A and B is the set of all elements which are in either A or B or both, and it is denoted by A &cup; B.</li>
		<li><strong>Intersection:</strong> The intersection of two sets A and B is the set of all elements which are in both A and B, and it is denoted by A &cap; B.</li>
		<li><strong>Complement:</strong> The complement of a set A with respect to a universal set U is the set of all elements which are in U but not in A, and it is denoted by A'. </li>
		<li><strong>Difference:</strong> The difference of two sets A and B is the set of all elements which are in A but not in B, and it is denoted by A - B.</li>
		<li><strong>Cartesian Product:</strong> The cartesian product of two sets A and B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a is an element of A and b is an element of B, and it is denoted by A x B.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Venn Diagrams</h2>
	<p>Venn diagrams are graphical representations of sets, used to illustrate set relationships and operations. A Venn diagram consists of a rectangle representing the universal set U, and circles representing sets A and B. The area inside the circles represents the elements which are in the sets, while the area outside the circles represents the elements which are not in the sets. The overlapping area represents the elements which are in both sets.</p>

	<title>Relations and Functions</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Relations and Functions</h1>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Relations and functions are important concepts in mathematics. They are used to describe how elements in a set are related to each other and how they can be mapped to other sets.</p>

	<h2>Relations</h2>
	<p>A relation between two sets is a set of ordered pairs. Each ordered pair contains an element from the first set, called the domain, and an element from the second set, called the range. For example, {(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)} is a relation between the sets {1, 3, 5} and {2, 4, 6}.</p>
	<p>Relations can be represented graphically using arrows, dots, or other symbols. A directed graph is a graphical representation of a relation where the elements of the domain are represented as vertices and the elements of the range are represented as arrows pointing to the corresponding vertices.</p>

	<h2>Functions</h2>
	<p>A function is a special type of relation where each element in the domain is paired with exactly one element in the range. In other words, no two ordered pairs have the same first element. For example, the set {(1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6)} is not a function because the element 1 is paired with 2 and 6.</p>
	<p>Functions can be represented graphically using a coordinate plane. The x-axis represents the domain and the y-axis represents the range. The graph of a function is a set of points (x, y) that satisfy the function rule.</p>

	<h2>Types of Functions</h2>
	<p>There are several types of functions, including:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>One-to-one functions: Each element in the domain is paired with exactly one element in the range, and no two elements in the domain are paired with the same element in the range.</li>
		<li>Onto functions: Each element in the range is paired with at least one element in the domain.</li>
		<li>Bijection: A function that is both one-to-one and onto is called a bijection.</li>
		<li>Inverse functions: A function that reverses the direction of the arrows in a relation is called an inverse function. The inverse of a function f is denoted by f<sup>-1</sup>.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>Relations and functions are important concepts in mathematics. They are used in many areas of science, engineering, and economics to describe how elements in a set are related to each other and how they can be mapped to other sets. By understanding relations and functions, you can solve problems and make predictions about real-world situations.</p>

	<title>Trigonometric Functions</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Trigonometric Functions</h1>
	<p>Trigonometric functions are a set of mathematical functions used to relate the angles and sides of a right-angled triangle. These functions are based on the ratios of the sides of a right-angled triangle.</p>
	<h2>The Six Trigonometric Functions</h2>
	<p>There are six trigonometric functions:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>sine (sin)</li>
		<li>cosine (cos)</li>
		<li>tangent (tan)</li>
		<li>cosecant (csc)</li>
		<li>secant (sec)</li>
		<li>cotangent (cot)</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The sine, cosine, and tangent functions are the primary functions used in trigonometry. The other three functions are the reciprocal functions of these primary functions.</p>
	<h2>Definitions of Trigonometric Functions</h2>
	<p>The six trigonometric functions can be defined in terms of the sides of a right-angled triangle:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The sine function (sin θ) is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse (sin θ = opposite/hypotenuse).</li>
		<li>The cosine function (cos θ) is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse (cos θ = adjacent/hypotenuse).</li>
		<li>The tangent function (tan θ) is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side (tan θ = opposite/adjacent).</li>
		<li>The cosecant function (csc θ) is the reciprocal of the sine function (csc θ = hypotenuse/opposite).</li>
		<li>The secant function (sec θ) is the reciprocal of the cosine function (sec θ = hypotenuse/adjacent).</li>
		<li>The cotangent function (cot θ) is the reciprocal of the tangent function (cot θ = adjacent/opposite).</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Trigonometric Identities</h2>
	<p>Trigonometric identities are equations that are true for all values of the variables that appear in the equations. These identities are used to simplify expressions involving trigonometric functions.</p>
	<p>Here are some of the commonly used trigonometric identities:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>sin² θ + cos² θ = 1</li>
		<li>1 + tan² θ = sec² θ</li>
		<li>1 + cot² θ = csc² θ</li>
		<li>sin (θ ± φ) = sin θ cos φ ± cos θ sin φ</li>
		<li>cos (θ ± φ) = cos θ cos φ ∓ sin θ sin φ</li>
		<li>tan (θ ± φ) = (tan θ ± tan φ)/(1 ∓ tan θ tan φ)</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Applications of Trigonometry</h2>
	<p>Trigonometry has many practical applications, including:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Navigation: Trigonometry is used in navigation to calculate the position of an object based on its distance from known points.</li>

		<li>Architecture:Trigonometry is used in architecture to calculate angles, heights, and distances. Architects use trigonometry to design and build structures that are both functional and aesthetically pleasing. For example, they use trigonometry to calculate the height and angle of a roof or the length and angle of a stairway.</li>

	    <li>Engineering:Trigonometry is used in engineering to design and build structures such as bridges, buildings, and machines. Engineers use trigonometry to calculate the forces and stresses on materials and to design structures that can withstand these forces. For example, they use trigonometry to calculate the angle and length of the supports needed to build a bridge.</li>

    	<li>Astronomy:Trigonometry is used in astronomy to calculate the positions and movements of celestial bodies. Astronomers use trigonometry to determine the distance between stars and planets and to calculate the angle and direction of a planet's orbit. They also use trigonometry to calculate the angle and distance between the Earth and the Moon.</li>

	<title>Principle of Mathematical Induction</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Mathematics UNIT-2: Algebra</h1>
	<h1>Principle of Mathematical Induction</h1>

	<p>The Principle of Mathematical Induction is a powerful tool used in mathematics to prove statements about all natural numbers. It is a method of proof by which a statement is proved to be true for infinitely many natural numbers, by proving that it is true for the first natural number and then showing that if it is true for any one natural number, then it must also be true for the next natural number.</p>

	<h2>The Principle of Mathematical Induction:</h2>

	<p>Let P(n) be a statement about a natural number n. If:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>P(1) is true.</li>
		<li>For every natural number k, if P(k) is true, then P(k+1) is also true.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Then P(n) is true for every natural number n.</p>

	<p>The first part of the principle, P(1), is known as the base case. It is used to prove that the statement is true for the first natural number. The second part, the induction step, is used to prove that if the statement is true for any one natural number, then it must also be true for the next natural number.</p>

	<h2>Example:</h2>

	<p>Let P(n) be the statement that 1 + 2 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2 for all natural numbers n.</p>

	<p><strong>Base case:</strong> P(1) is true, since 1 = 1(1+1)/2.</p>

	<p><strong>Induction step:</strong> Assume that P(k) is true for some natural number k, that is, 1 + 2 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2.</p>

	<p>We need to show that P(k+1) is also true, that is, 1 + 2 + ... + k + (k+1) = (k+1)(k+2)/2.</p>

	<p>Adding (k+1) to both sides of the equation 1 + 2 + ... + k = k(k+1)/2 gives:</p>

	<p>1 + 2 + ... + k + (k+1) = k(k+1)/2 + (k+1).</p>

	<p>Factoring out (k+1)/2 gives:</p>

	<p>1 + 2 + ... + k + (k+1) = (k+1)(k/2 + 1/2).</p>

	<p>Simplifying the expression on the right gives:</p>

	<p>1 + 2 + ... + k + (k+1) = (k+1)(k+2)/2.</p>

	<p>Therefore, P(k+1) is true if P(k) is true.</p>

	<p>By the Principle of Mathematical Induction, P(n) is true for all natural numbers n. Therefore, we can conclude that 1 + 2 + ... + n = n(n+1)/2 for all natural numbers n.</p>

	<title>Complex Numbers and Quadratic Equations</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Complex Numbers and Quadratic Equations</h1>

	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Quadratic equations have been studied for centuries, and they play a significant role in many areas of mathematics and science. However, in some cases, the solutions to quadratic equations are not real numbers. In order to deal with these cases, mathematicians have introduced the concept of complex numbers.</p>

	<h2>Complex Numbers</h2>
	<p>Complex numbers are numbers that can be expressed in the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers, and i is the imaginary unit, which is defined as the square root of -1. Complex numbers are often represented graphically in the complex plane, where the horizontal axis represents the real part of the complex number and the vertical axis represents the imaginary part.</p>

	<h3>Addition and Subtraction of Complex Numbers</h3>
	<p>The addition and subtraction of complex numbers is done by adding or subtracting the real and imaginary parts separately. For example:</p>
	<blockquote>(3 + 2i) + (4 - 5i) = (3 + 4) + (2i - 5i) = 7 - 3i</blockquote>

	<h3>Multiplication of Complex Numbers</h3>
	<p>The multiplication of complex numbers is done using the distributive property and the fact that i<sup>2</sup> = -1. For example:</p>
	<blockquote>(3 + 2i)(4 - 5i) = 12 - 15i + 8i - 10i<sup>2</sup> = 22 - 7i</blockquote>

	<h3>Division of Complex Numbers</h3>
	<p>The division of complex numbers is done using the conjugate of the denominator. For example:</p>
	<blockquote>\frac{(3 + 2i)}{(4 - 5i)} = \frac{(3 + 2i)(4 + 5i)}{(4 - 5i)(4 + 5i)} = \frac{22 + 7i}{41}</blockquote>

	<h2>Quadratic Equations with Complex Solutions</h2>
	<p>Quadratic equations with complex solutions can be solved using the quadratic formula, which is:</p>
	<blockquote>x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}</blockquote>
	<p>where a, b, and c are coefficients of the quadratic equation ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0. If the value under the square root is negative, then the solutions are complex.</p>

	<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>Complex numbers provide a powerful tool for dealing with quadratic equations that have complex solutions. They are widely used in many areas of mathematics and science, including engineering, physics, and computer science.</p>

    <title>Linear Inequalities</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Chapter 6 - Linear Inequalities</h1>
    <p>Linear Inequalities are equations that involve linear expressions and an inequality sign. They are used to represent regions in a coordinate plane that satisfy the given conditions.</p>
    <h2>Solving Linear Inequalities</h2>
    <p>The solution to a linear inequality is a range of values that satisfy the inequality. To solve a linear inequality:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Isolate the variable term on one side of the inequality sign.</li>
      <li>Identify the sign of the coefficient of the variable term. If it is positive, the inequality sign remains the same. If it is negative, the inequality sign is flipped.</li>
      <li>Simplify both sides of the inequality by distributing any coefficients and combining like terms.</li>
      <li>Graph the solution on a number line.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>System of Linear Inequalities</h2>
    <p>A system of linear inequalities is a set of two or more linear inequalities that are to be solved simultaneously. The solution is the region in a coordinate plane where all the inequalities in the system are satisfied.</p>
    <h2>Properties of Linear Inequalities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If we add or subtract the same number from both sides of a linear inequality, the inequality remains unchanged.</li>
      <li>If we multiply or divide both sides of a linear inequality by a positive number, the inequality remains unchanged.</li>
      <li>If we multiply or divide both sides of a linear inequality by a negative number, the inequality sign is flipped.</li>

	<title>Permutations and Combinations</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Permutations and Combinations</h1>
	<p>Permutation and Combination are two important concepts in mathematics, which are used to count and calculate the possible number of arrangements and selections of objects, respectively.</p>
	
	<h2>Permutation</h2>
	<p>A permutation is an arrangement of objects or symbols in a specific order. The number of permutations of n objects taken r at a time is given by:</p>
	<p>P(n, r) = n!/(n-r)!, where n is the total number of objects and r is the number of objects selected for the permutation.</p>
	
	<h2>Combination</h2>
	<p>A combination is a selection of objects or symbols from a set, where the order does not matter. The number of combinations of n objects taken r at a time is given by:</p>
	<p>C(n, r) = n!/(r!(n-r)!), where n is the total number of objects and r is the number of objects selected for the combination.</p>
	
	<h2>Properties of Permutations and Combinations</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The value of P(n, r) and C(n, r) is always a positive integer.</li>
		<li>If n and r are integers, then P(n, r) = P(n, n-r) and C(n, r) = C(n, n-r).</li>
		<li>If n and r are integers, then P(n, r) = nP(n-1, r-1) and C(n, r) = C(n-1, r-1) + C(n-1, r).</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Examples</h2>
	<p>Let's look at some examples of permutations and combinations:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>A company has 5 employees and wants to select a team of 3 to represent the company. How many different teams can be formed?</li>
		<p>C(5, 3) = 5!/(3!(5-3)!) = 10</p>
		
		<li>A school has 8 students and wants to select a class president, vice-president, and treasurer. How many different ways can this be done?</li>
		<p>P(8, 3) = 8!/5! = 8*7*6 = 336</p>
		
		<li>A pizza parlor offers 10 toppings for their pizza. A customer wants to order a pizza with 3 different toppings. How many different pizzas can be ordered?</li>
		<p>C(10, 3) = 10!/(3!7!) = 120</p>

	<title>Binomial Theorem</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Binomial Theorem</h1>
	<p>The Binomial Theorem is a powerful tool used in algebra to expand expressions of the form (a + b)^n where n is a positive integer. The theorem provides a formula for finding the coefficients of each term in the expansion.</p>

	<h2>Binomial Coefficients</h2>
	<p>The coefficients in the expansion of (a + b)^n are known as binomial coefficients and are denoted by C(n, r) where n is the power of the binomial and r is the index of the term in the expansion. The binomial coefficient can be calculated using the following formula:</p>
	<p>C(n, r) = n! / (r! * (n - r)!)</p>

	<h2>Binomial Theorem Formula</h2>
	<p>The formula for expanding (a + b)^n using the binomial coefficients is:</p>
	<p>(a + b)^n = C(n, 0)a^n b^0 + C(n, 1)a^(n-1) b^1 + ... + C(n, r)a^(n-r) b^r + ... + C(n, n)a^0 b^n</p>

	<h2>Examples</h2>
	<p>Let's look at some examples of using the binomial theorem:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Expand (2x + y)^3</li>
		<p>We first calculate the binomial coefficients:</p>
		<p>C(3, 0) = 1, C(3, 1) = 3, C(3, 2) = 3, C(3, 3) = 1</p>
		<p>Using the binomial theorem formula:</p>
		<p>(2x + y)^3 = 1*(2x)^3 y^0 + 3*(2x)^2 y^1 + 3*(2x)^1 y^2 + 1*(2x)^0 y^3</p>
		<p>Simplifying:</p>
		<p>(2x + y)^3 = 8x^3 + 12x^2 y + 6xy^2 + y^3</p>
		<li>Expand (a - b)^4</li>
		<p>We first calculate the binomial coefficients:</p>
		<p>C(4, 0) = 1, C(4, 1) = 4, C(4, 2) = 6, C(4, 3) = 4, C(4, 4) = 1</p>
		<p>Using the binomial theorem formula:</p>
		<p>(a - b)^4 = 1*(a)^4 (-b)^0 + 4*(a)^3 (-b)^1 + 6*(a)^2 (-b)^2 + 4*(a)^1 (-b)^3 + 1*(a)^0 (-b)^4</p>
		<p>Simplifying:</p>
		<p>(a - b)^4 = a^4 - 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 - 4ab^3 + b^4</p>
	</ol>

  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Applications of Binomial Theorem</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Applications of Binomial Theorem</h1>
    
    <h2>1. Expansion of Binomials</h2>
    <p>The binomial theorem can be used to expand expressions of the form (a + b)^n, where n is a positive integer. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>(a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2</li>
      <li>(a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3</li>
      <li>(a + b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>2. Probability</h2>
    <p>The binomial theorem can be used to find probabilities of certain events. For example, consider flipping a coin n times and getting exactly k heads. The probability of this happening is given by:</p>
    <p>P(exactly k heads) = (n choose k) * p^k * (1 - p)^(n-k)</p>
    <p>where (n choose k) is the number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items, and p is the probability of getting a head on each flip.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Pascal's Triangle</h2>
    <p>The coefficients in the expansion of (a + b)^n form a triangular pattern known as Pascal's Triangle. This pattern can be used to quickly find the coefficients for any given value of n. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The third row of Pascal's Triangle is 1 2 1, which corresponds to the coefficients in the expansion of (a + b)^2.</li>
      <li>The fourth row of Pascal's Triangle is 1 3 3 1, which corresponds to the coefficients in the expansion of (a + b)^3.</li>
      <li>The fifth row of Pascal's Triangle is 1 4 6 4 1, which corresponds to the coefficients in the expansion of (a + b)^4.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>4. Combinatorics</h2>
    <p>The binomial theorem can be used in combinatorics to find the number of ways to choose or arrange items. For example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The number of ways to choose k items from a set of n items is given by (n choose k).</li>
      <li>The number of ways to arrange n items is n! (n factorial), which is the product of all positive integers up to n.</li>
      <li>The number of ways to arrange n items with k of them being identical is given by n!/k!.</li>
    </ul>

	<title>Mathematics Unit 2 - Algebra Chapter 9: Sequences and Series</title>
</head>
<body>
	<h1>Sequences and Series</h1>
	<p>A sequence is an ordered list of numbers. The numbers in a sequence are called terms. A series is the sum of the terms in a sequence.</p>

	<h2>Arithmetic Sequences and Series</h2>
	<p>An arithmetic sequence is a sequence in which each term after the first is obtained by adding a constant d to the preceding term. The constant d is called the common difference. The nth term of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula:</p>
	<p>a<sub>n</sub> = a<sub>1</sub> + (n - 1)d</p>
	<p>The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic series can be found using the formula:</p>
	<p>S<sub>n</sub> = n/2(a<sub>1</sub> + a<sub>n</sub>)</p>

	<h2>Geometric Sequences and Series</h2>
	<p>A geometric sequence is a sequence in which each term after the first is obtained by multiplying the preceding term by a constant r. The constant r is called the common ratio. The nth term of a geometric sequence can be found using the formula:</p>
	<p>a<sub>n</sub> = a<sub>1</sub>r<sup>n-1</sup></p>
	<p>The sum of the first n terms of a geometric series can be found using the formula:</p>
	<p>S<sub>n</sub> = a<sub>1</sub>(1 - r<sup>n</sup>)/(1 - r)</p>

	<h2>Harmonic Series</h2>
	<p>A harmonic series is a series of the form:</p>
	<p>1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... + 1/n</p>
	<p>The nth partial sum of the harmonic series is denoted by H<sub>n</sub> and can be approximated by:</p>
	<p>H<sub>n</sub> ≈ ln(n) + γ, where γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant.</p>

	<h2>Telescoping Series</h2>
	<p>A telescoping series is a series in which many terms cancel each other out. The sum of a telescoping series can be found by rewriting the series as a difference of two simpler expressions.</p>

	<h2>Convergence and Divergence</h2>
	<p>A series converges if its sequence of partial sums approaches a finite limit. Otherwise, the series diverges. The terms of a convergent series must approach zero as n approaches infinity.</p>

	<h2>Tests for Convergence and Divergence</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>The Divergence Test: If the limit of the terms of a series does not approach zero, then the series diverges.</li>
		<li>The Integral Test: If f(n) is a continuous, positive, decreasing function for n ≥ 1, and a<sub>n</sub> = f(n), then the series converges if and only if the improper integral of f(x) from 1 to infinity converges.</li>

	<h1>Coordinate Geometry: Chapter 10 - Straight Lines</h1>
	<p>Coordinate geometry is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of geometrical figures in a coordinate plane. In this chapter, we will study about straight lines which are an important concept in coordinate geometry.</p>
	<h2>Introduction to Straight Lines</h2>
<p>A straight line is the shortest distance between two points in a plane. It is also known as a linear function. The equation of a straight line is given by:</p>
<p>y = mx + c</p>
<p>where m is the slope of the line and c is the y-intercept.</p>

<h2>Slope of a Straight Line</h2>
<p>The slope of a straight line is the ratio of the change in y to the change in x. It is denoted by m and is given by:</p>
<p>m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)</p>
<p>where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are any two points on the line.</p>

<h2>Forms of Equation of a Straight Line</h2>
<p>There are three forms of equation of a straight line:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Point-slope form: y - y1 = m(x - x1)</li>
	<li>Slope-intercept form: y = mx + c</li>
	<li>Two-point form: (y - y1)/(x - x1) = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Angle between Two Straight Lines</h2>
<p>The angle between two straight lines is the angle made by the lines at the point of intersection. It is given by:</p>
<p>θ = | tan⁻¹ [(m2 - m1) / (1 + m1m2)] |</p>
<p>where m1 and m2 are the slopes of the two lines.</p>

<h2>Distance between Two Points and a Point and a Line</h2>
<p>The distance between two points P(x1, y1) and Q(x2, y2) is given by:</p>
<p>d = √[(x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²]</p>
<p>The distance between a point P(x1, y1) and a line Ax + By + C = 0 is given by:</p>
<p>d = |Ax1 + By1 + C| / √(A² + B²)</p>

<h2>Intersection of Two Lines</h2>
<p>Two lines can intersect at a point, be parallel or coincide with each other. The intersection point of two lines is given by solving the two equations simultaneously.</p>

<h2>Angle between Line and X-axis or Y-axis</h2>
<p>When a line intersects with X-axis or Y-axis, it forms an angle with the respective axis. The angle between the line and the X-axis is known as the angle of inclination, and it is denoted by &theta;. Similarly, the angle between the line and the Y-axis is known as the angle of declination, and it is denoted by &alpha;.</p>	<p>Mathematically, the angle of inclination of a line is given by:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">&theta; = tan<sup>-1</sup>(m)</div>
<p>where 'm' is the slope of the line.</p>
<p>The angle of declination can be found by subtracting the angle of inclination from 90 degrees. That is:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">&alpha; = 90&deg; - &theta;</div>
<p>Therefore, if the slope of a line is known, the angles of inclination and declination can be calculated, which helps in analyzing the properties and characteristics of the line.</p>

	<h1>Introduction to Three-Dimensional Geometry</h1>
<p>Three-dimensional geometry deals with the study of figures in three-dimensional space. In this chapter, we will learn about the Cartesian coordinate system in three dimensions, distance and section formulas, and the equations of lines and planes in space.</p>

<h2>Cartesian Coordinate System in Three Dimensions</h2>
<p>The Cartesian coordinate system in three dimensions consists of three mutually perpendicular axes: x-axis, y-axis, and z-axis. The point where the three axes intersect is called the origin. Any point in three-dimensional space can be represented by its coordinates (x, y, z), where x is the distance from the yz-plane along the x-axis, y is the distance from the xz-plane along the y-axis, and z is the distance from the xy-plane along the z-axis.</p>

<h2>Distance and Section Formulas</h2>
<p>The distance between two points P(x1, y1, z1) and Q(x2, y2, z2) in three-dimensional space is given by:</p>
<div>
    <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?d(P,Q)=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2&plus;(y_2-y_1)^2&plus;(z_2-z_1)^2}" title="Distance Formula" />
</div>
<p>The section formula divides a line segment between two points in a given ratio. Let P(x1, y1, z1) and Q(x2, y2, z2) be two points in three-dimensional space, and let M(x, y, z) be a point that divides the line segment PQ in the ratio m:n. Then the coordinates of M are given by:</p>
<div>
    <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{x-x_1}{x_2-x_1}=\frac{y-y_1}{y_2-y_1}=\frac{z-z_1}{z_2-z_1}=\frac{m}{m&plus;n}" title="Section Formula" />
</div>

<h2>Equations of Lines in Space</h2>
<p>A line in three-dimensional space can be represented by a vector equation or a symmetric equation. The vector equation of a line passing through the point P(x1, y1, z1) in the direction of the vector a = (a1, a2, a3) is given by:</p>
<div>
    <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\overrightarrow{r}=P+t\overrightarrow{a}" title="Vector Equation of a Line" />
</div>
<p>The symmetric equation of a line passing through the point P(x1, y1, z1) and parallel to the vector a = (a1, a2, a3) is given by:</p>
<div>
    <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\frac{x-x_1}{a_1}=\frac{y-y_1}{a_2}=\frac{z-z_1}{a_3}" title="Symmetric Equation of a Line" />
</div>

<h2>Limits and Derivatives</h2>
<p>Calculus is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of change. It has two major components: Differential Calculus and Integral Calculus. Differential Calculus deals with the study of rates of change and slopes of curves, while Integral Calculus deals with the study of areas under curves and accumulation of quantities.</p>
<p>The concept of limit is central to both Differential and Integral Calculus. The limit of a function is the value that the function approaches as its input approaches a certain value. Limits are used to define derivatives and integrals.</p>
<h3>Limits</h3>
<p>Formally, we say that the limit of a function f(x) as x approaches a is L if for any ε > 0 there exists a δ > 0 such that if 0 < |x - a| < δ, then |f(x) - L| < ε. Intuitively, this means that as x gets closer and closer to a, f(x) gets closer and closer to L.</p>
<p>Limits can be evaluated algebraically, graphically, or using the squeeze theorem. They can also be evaluated using L'Hopital's rule, which states that the limit of the ratio of two functions that approach zero or infinity can be evaluated by taking the derivative of the numerator and denominator and then evaluating the limit again.</p>
<h3>Derivatives</h3>
<p>The derivative of a function f(x) at a point x=a is the slope of the tangent line to the curve of the function at that point. It is defined as the limit of the difference quotient as h approaches 0, i.e. f'(a) = lim (h → 0) [f(a + h) - f(a)] / h.</p>
<p>The derivative of a function can be used to find the rate of change of the function at any point. It can also be used to find the maximum and minimum values of the function, and to solve optimization problems.</p>
<p>There are several rules for differentiating functions, such as the power rule, product rule, quotient rule, and chain rule. These rules can be used to find the derivative of any function.</p>
<h3>Applications of Limits and Derivatives</h3>
<p>Limits and derivatives have many applications in various fields of science and engineering. They are used to model and analyze phenomena that involve change, such as motion, growth, and decay.</p>
<p>For example, in physics, derivatives are used to find the velocity and acceleration of an object, while limits are used to find the instantaneous velocity and acceleration at a point in time. In economics, derivatives are used to find the marginal cost and revenue of a product, while limits are used to find the limit of a production function.</p>
<p>Other applications of limits and derivatives include optimization problems in engineering, population growth models in biology, and signal processing in computer science.</p>

<h1>Mathematics Unit 5: Mathematical Reasoning - Chapter 14: Mathematical Reasoning</h1>

<h2>Introduction to Mathematical Reasoning</h2>
<p>Mathematical reasoning is the process of using logical thinking to make conclusions based on mathematical concepts and principles. It involves analyzing and solving problems using deductive reasoning, which involves making inferences based on logical rules.</p>

<h2>Types of Mathematical Reasoning</h2>
<p>There are two main types of mathematical reasoning:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Deductive reasoning:</strong> Deductive reasoning involves making logical inferences based on a set of premises or axioms. In mathematics, this involves using logical rules to prove mathematical statements or theorems. For example, if we know that all mammals have fur, and a dog is a mammal, we can deduce that a dog has fur.</li>
  <li><strong>Inductive reasoning:</strong> Inductive reasoning involves using specific examples or observations to make generalizations or hypotheses. In mathematics, this involves using patterns or observations to make conjectures or formulate mathematical theories. For example, if we observe that the first few terms of a sequence are increasing, we can make the conjecture that the sequence is increasing.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Logical Connectives</h2>
<p>In mathematical reasoning, we often use logical connectives to join propositions or statements together. The main logical connectives are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Conjunction:</strong> A conjunction is a statement that joins two propositions using the word "and". For example, "The sky is blue and the grass is green."</li>
  <li><strong>Disjunction:</strong> A disjunction is a statement that joins two propositions using the word "or". For example, "You can have cake or ice cream for dessert."</li>
  <li><strong>Negation:</strong> Negation is the process of forming the opposite of a proposition or statement. In mathematical notation, we use the symbol "~" or "¬" to represent negation. For example, "It is not raining today" can be written as "~(It is raining today)" or "¬(It is raining today)".</li>
  <li><strong>Implication:</strong> Implication is the process of connecting two propositions such that if the first proposition is true, then the second proposition must also be true. In mathematical notation, we use the symbol "→" to represent implication. For example, "If it is raining outside, then I will bring an umbrella" can be written as "Raining → Bring umbrella".</li>
  <li><strong>Biconditional:</strong> A biconditional is a statement that joins two propositions such that they are both true or both false. In mathematical notation, we use the symbol "↔" to represent biconditional. For example, "I will bring an umbrella if and only if it is raining outside" can be written as "Raining ↔ Bring umbrella".</li>
</ul>

<h2>Methods of Proof</h2>
<p>In mathematical reasoning, there are several methods of proof that are commonly used to establish the validity of a mathematical statement or theorem. Some of the most common methods of proof are:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Direct proof:</strong> A direct proof involves starting with the premises or axioms and using deductive reasoning to arrive at the conclusion. For example, to prove that the sum of
  	<h2>Theorem:</h2>
<p>If a and b are two positive integers such that a+b is even, then either a is even and b is even or a is odd and b is odd.</p>

<h2>Proof:</h2>
<p>Suppose a and b are positive integers such that a+b is even.</p>
<p>Then there are two possibilities:</p>

<p><strong>Case 1:</strong> Both a and b are even</p>
<p>Let a=2m and b=2n, where m and n are positive integers.</p>
<p>Then a+b = 2m + 2n = 2(m+n), which is even.</p>
<p>Therefore, if a and b are even, then a+b is even.</p>

<p><strong>Case 2:</strong> Both a and b are odd</p>
<p>Let a=2m+1 and b=2n+1, where m and n are positive integers.</p>
<p>Then a+b = (2m+1) + (2n+1) = 2(m+n+1), which is even.</p>
<p>Therefore, if a and b are odd, then a+b is even.</p>

<p>Thus, we have shown that if a+b is even, then either a is even and b is even or a is odd and b is odd.</p>
<p>This completes the proof.</p>

<h1>Statistics</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Statistics is the branch of mathematics that deals with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of data. The primary goal of statistics is to provide useful information based on data. Statistics is used in various fields such as business, finance, healthcare, social sciences, and many more.</p>
<h2>Collection of Data</h2>
<p>Data can be collected in various ways such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Primary Data:</b> This type of data is collected by the researcher directly from the source through surveys, questionnaires, interviews, etc.</li>
  <li><b>Secondary Data:</b> This type of data is collected from other sources like books, journals, reports, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Presentation of Data</h2>
<p>Data can be presented in various ways such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Tabular Form:</b> Data can be presented in the form of a table, which makes it easy to understand and compare different data sets.</li>
  <li><b>Graphical Form:</b> Data can be presented in the form of graphs like bar graphs, line graphs, pie charts, etc. which makes it easy to visualize and understand the data.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Measures of Central Tendency</h2>
<p>Measures of central tendency are used to represent the central or typical value of a data set. The commonly used measures of central tendency are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Mean:</b> Mean is the average of all the values in a data set. It is calculated by adding all the values in a data set and then dividing by the total number of values.</li>
  <li><b>Median:</b> Median is the middle value in a data set when arranged in ascending or descending order.</li>
  <li><b>Mode:</b> Mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a data set.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Measures of Dispersion</h2>
<p>Measures of dispersion are used to measure the variability of a data set. The commonly used measures of dispersion are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Range:</b> Range is the difference between the maximum and minimum value in a data set.</li>
  <li><b>Variance:</b> Variance is the average of the squared differences from the mean.</li>
  <li><b>Standard Deviation:</b> Standard deviation is the square root of the variance.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Correlation and Regression</h2>
<p>Correlation and regression are used to measure the relationship between two variables in a data set. Correlation measures the strength of the relationship, while regression is used to predict the value of one variable based on the value of another variable.</p>
<h2>Sampling and Estimation</h2>
<p>Sampling is the process of selecting a subset of a population to make inferences about the entire population. Estimation is the process of using sample data to estimate the characteristics of the population. The commonly used methods of sampling and estimation are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Random Sampling:</b> In random sampling, each member of the population has an equal chance of being selected for the sample.</li>

  <h1>Chapter 16: Probability</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. In probability theory, we study the behavior of random events or experiments, and we use probability to quantify the chance of different outcomes.</p>

<h2>Experiment, Outcomes, and Events</h2>
<p>An experiment is any process or activity that can produce some well-defined outcomes. The outcomes of an experiment are the possible results that can be obtained, and they are usually denoted by the letters A, B, C, and so on. An event is a set of one or more outcomes of an experiment.</p>

<h2>Sample Space and Events</h2>
<p>The sample space of an experiment is the set of all possible outcomes of that experiment. The sample space is denoted by the symbol S. An event is a subset of the sample space. We use set notation to denote events. For example, if the sample space of an experiment is S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}, then the event "getting an even number" can be denoted as E = {2, 4, 6}.</p>

<h2>Probability of an Event</h2>
<p>The probability of an event E, denoted by P(E), is a number between 0 and 1 that represents the likelihood of the event occurring. If P(E) = 0, then the event E is impossible and cannot occur. If P(E) = 1, then the event E is certain and will always occur. If P(E) lies between 0 and 1, then the event E is possible but not certain to occur.</p>

<h2>Types of Probability</h2>
<h3>Classical Probability</h3>
<p>The classical or theoretical probability of an event E is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes of the event to the total number of possible outcomes of the experiment, assuming that all outcomes are equally likely. This is also called the "a priori" probability, because it is based on the assumption that we know the probability distribution of the outcomes before conducting the experiment.</p>

<h3>Empirical Probability</h3>
<p>The empirical or experimental probability of an event E is the ratio of the number of times the event occurs to the total number of times the experiment is repeated. This is also called the "a posteriori" probability, because it is based on the observation of the outcomes of the experiment.</p>

<h3>Subjective Probability</h3>
<p>The subjective probability of an event E is a measure of an individual's degree of belief or confidence that the event will occur. This type of probability is subjective, because it depends on the individual's personal opinion or judgment.</p>

<h2>Basic Rules of Probability</h2>
<h3>Addition Rule</h3>
<p>The addition rule of probability states that the probability of the union of two events A and B is given by:</p>
<p>P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)</p>

<h3>Multiplication Rule</h3>
<p>The multiplication rule of probability states that the probability of the intersection of two events A and B is given by:</p>
<p>P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B|A)</p>
<p>where P(B|A) is the conditional probability of event B given that event A has occurred.</p>
