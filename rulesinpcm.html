        <h1>Basic PCM Rules and Regulations</h1>
        <p>
          PCM stands for Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics. It is a popular
          stream among students who want to pursue a career in engineering,
          architecture, or other related fields. If you are planning to take up
          PCM in your higher secondary education, there are a few basic rules
          and regulations that you should be aware of.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You should have a strong foundation in mathematics and science to
            excel in the PCM stream.
          </li>
          <li>
            You will be required to study physics, chemistry, and mathematics in
            detail in the PCM stream.
          </li>
          <li>
            Regular attendance and participation in class is important to
            understand and grasp the concepts taught in the PCM stream.
          </li>
          <li>
            You will be required to work on practical experiments and projects
            in the PCM stream.
          </li>
          <li>
            There will be periodic assessments, tests, and examinations to test
            your knowledge and understanding of the PCM concepts.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          By following these basic rules and regulations and putting in the
          required effort and dedication, you can excel in the PCM stream and
          pave the way for a successful career in engineering, architecture, or
          other related fields.
